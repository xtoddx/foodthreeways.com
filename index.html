        <h3>My Journey</h3>

<p>In early 2013 I bought a share in a farm offering Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), which entitles me to a portion of the harvest each week. I pick up my share from the farmers market less than a mile from my house. All the food is grown one county away from my house.</p>

<p>I do this simply because I gardened growing up and I want to feel closeness to my food again. There are a host of economic and environmental reasons to buy local produce. Advocates have taking to calling this process Farm to Table, and a economic movement of Slow Money has sprung up to empower this process. I am not an advocate, just a guy making food. The irony is that as a kid with a garden, the only things I wanted to eat were hot dogs and boxed macaroni and cheese, which I can't imagine eating now.</p>

<p>A CSA gives you what they grow. This may not be what you want, what you are accustomed to, or what you know how to prepare. This project is to document the foods I've received and to share some recipes for preparing them. Not every recipe I publish will be something I've cooked. Not everything I've cooked will be tasty. I'll document those things and give preference to the recipes that I have cooked and enjoyed.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>My name is Todd Willey. I'm a software engineer, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. I live in the beautiful bluegrass of Lexington, KY.</p>

<p>I consider my connection to the earth part of the heritage, passed down to me from before we were the fist settlers to cross the Cumberland Gap. While some of my family raise livestock and produce natural soaps and cheeses, most have gone the route of offices or other air-conditioned accommodations. This move to return to food that comes from the dirt I know is my attempt to bridge the two words, or at least to carry my traditions forward with me as our economic interactions take a different shape.</p>
